# About

This SQL project explores sales data from a U.S. national candy distributor to gain insights into top-performing product divisions, sales trends, and customer behavior. By analyzing this data, the goal is to identify opportunities for improving and optimizing sales strategies. The dataset includes sales and geospatial information related to factory-to-customer shipments, encompassing customer and factory locations, sales orders and goals, as well as detailed product information.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze sales performance, profitability, and customer trends using SQL. This involves answering key business questions that support data-driven decision-making for sales optimization and operational improvements.

# Data
The dataset, titled "US Candy Distributor", was obtained from Maven Analytics and consists of five tables with a total of 10,194 records and 39 fields. The data was imported into SQL Server for analysis. As the dataset was already clean and well-structured, no additional preprocessing or cleaning was necessary.
